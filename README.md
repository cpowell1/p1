## Outside resources
  - [Array to String Conversion Error](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20017409/how-to-solve-php-error-notice-array-to-string-conversion-in) I used this resource to learn how to get my array output to read as a string instead of an integer. I learned to put the quotes around the array key's placement if I wanted a string output.
  - [Strings with Apostrophes](https://bytes.com/topic/php/answers/736196-how-handle-string-containing-apostrophes-quotation-marks) I needed this resource to help my strings include words, such as I'm, output correctly in PHP.
  - [Get Random Item Out of Array](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4233407/get-random-item-from-array) I kept coding ```echo array_rand($quote) ``` and this resource showed me to put the ```$quote[array_rand($quote)]``` instead.
